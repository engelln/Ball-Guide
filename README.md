# Ball Guide
Source code for a game I created in 2018. All C# code can be found in the Assets/Scripts directory.

# Requirements
This game was created in the Unity engine. Any version should do, but it was created specifically in Unity 2018.1.6. The Android SDK can also be installed if you wish to build the APK.

# Setup
1. Clone this repository somewhere locally. 
2. Open Unity, and choose to open an existing project. Navigate to the local repository.
3. All scenes in Assets/Scenes will need to be added to the build settings. Click File -> Build Settings, and drag all the .unity files into the build settings prompt.
4. If running the game in engine, set the view to anything portrait.
